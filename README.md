Click in the open space to **add a node**, drag from one node to another to **add an edge**.  
Alt-drag a node to **move** the graph layout. 
Click a node or an edge to **select** it.

When a node is selected: **Delete** or **Backspace** removes the node.  
When an edge is selected: **f** fixes it in place, and **Delete** or **Backspace** removes the edge.

The inspiration for the digraph logic originally came from [rkirsling](http://rkirsling.github.com)'s modal logic playground.

This project is an attempt to make the solutions to network flow problems accessible the general public. This project uses the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to calculate the max flow. Special thanks to [Dimitris Achilloptas](http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~optas/) for the introduction to such a great algorithm!

- Multi-Edge Selection?
- Linear gravitation points?
