Click in the open space to **add a node**, drag from one node to another to **add an edge**.  
Alt-drag a node to **move** the graph layout.  
Click a node or an edge to **select** it.

When a node is selected: **Delete** removes the node.  
When an edge is selected: **f** fixes it in place, and **Delete** removes the edge.

The di-graph logic was borrowed from [rkirsling](http://rkirsling.github.com)!.

This project is an attempt to make the solutions to network flow problems accessible the general public. This project uses the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to calculate the max flow. Special thanks to [Dimitris Achilloptas](http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~optas/) for the introduction to such a great algorithm!
